# NEET Biology Questions Dataset

A comprehensive collection of NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) Biology questions designed to help students prepare for medical entrance examinations.

## About This Dataset

This dataset contains **793 carefully crafted multiple-choice questions** covering essential Biology topics that appear in NEET exams. Each question follows the standard NEET format with four answer choices and one correct answer.

### What's Inside

- **Questions**: Clear, exam-style questions covering key Biology concepts
- **Subject**: Biology (the core subject for NEET preparation)
- **Choices**: Four distinct multiple-choice options labeled A, B, C, D
- **Answers**: Correct answer marked for each question

### Topics Covered

The questions span across major Biology areas including:
- Plant Physiology and Anatomy
- Animal Physiology and Morphology
- Cell Biology and Genetics
- Ecology and Evolution
- Human Physiology
- And many more essential topics

## How to Use This Dataset

### For Students
